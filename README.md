# MidiGlass
MidiGlass is an old program that shows, alters and plays midi files.


If you want to use SoundFont copy the .dll files from

https://github.com/Ian-Macallan/MidiGlass/tree/main/fluidsynth-2.3.4-win10-x64/bin

or 

https://github.com/Ian-Macallan/MidiGlass/tree/main/fluidsynth-2.3.4-winXP-x86/bin

according to the version you use, and search Sound Font (.sf2) on the internet.
